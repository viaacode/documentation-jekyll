# meemoo SIP Specification

The meemoo SIP specification is available in the following versions:

## Version [2.0]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/diginstroom/sip/2.0/index.md %}) <span class="label label-yellow">Editor's Draft</span>

This major release ensures adherence of the meemoo SIP to the [EARK (C)SIP specification](https://earksip.dilcis.eu/). This version is being drafted and is **not yet supported**.

### What was **added** compared to the previous version?

- Conformance with the EARK (C)SIP 2.2 specification. For more details, check out [changes to 1.X section]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/diginstroom/sip/2.0/1_introduction.md %}#changes-compared-to-version-1x);
- Faulty references to previous versions of the specfication were corrected;
- A note was added to the overview that contains the exact E-ARK SIP version with which this specification is conformant;
- A number of small clarifications were added to the text to improve the understanding of certain requirements.

### What was **removed** compared to the previous version?

- The _Bag_ level was removed from the SIP, thereby also removing its dependency on the BagIt specification.

## Version [1.2]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/diginstroom/sip/1.2/index.md %}) <span class="label label-blue">Release Candidate</span>

This third release broadens support for written works and extends the metadata for the basic profile. This version is **not yet supported**.

### What was **added** compared to the previous version?

- The content profile _Newspaper_ was renamed to _Bibliographic_, which now supports more MODS elements. 
- The content profile _Basic_ now supports the descriptive `dc+schema.xml` metadata that was previously part of the content profile _Material Artwork_. The content profile _Material Artwork_ now refers to the content profile _Basic_ for its descriptive metadata requirements.

### What was **removed** compared to the previous version?

- The content profile _Bibliographic_, formerly known as _Newspaper_, does no longer allow the use of `dc+schema.xml` metadata.

## Version [1.1]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/diginstroom/sip/1.1/index.md %}) <span class="label label-green">Stable</span>
